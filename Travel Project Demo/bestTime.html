			<p>The best time to fly to the Moon is when there are no weather conditions that even might 
		hinder or damage the rocket as it takes off. This is because that if a Rocket were to
		be damaged on the way out of the atmosphere then it would be deadly to anyone inside of the 
		Rocket and they may be all killed.</p>
